# Update CLAUDE.md Prompt

**Purpose**: This document provides instructions for updating `CLAUDE.md` - the technical documentation that provides context to Claude Code in future sessions.

---

## Core Principle

CLAUDE.md should be **concise yet comprehensive** - a technical reference document, not a tutorial or detailed implementation guide.

**Target**: 350-400 lines (measured with `wc -l CLAUDE.md`)

---

## What to Include

### 1. Essential Context

- **What**: Project purpose and key capabilities
- **Why**: Architectural decisions and design rationale
- **How**: Quick reference patterns for common tasks

### 2. Critical Information

- Current metadata (date, Go version, dependencies)
- System architecture (high-level flow diagrams)
- Core components with file locations
- Key design patterns and their tradeoffs
- Developer guidelines for common modifications

### 3. Quick Reference Section

Place at the top for immediate access:

- Initialize connection
- Publish events
- Consume events
- Handle saga steps
- Error handling patterns

---

## What NOT to Include

### ‚ùå Avoid These

- **Verbose code walkthroughs**: Show pattern, not every line
- **Implementation details**: Those belong in code comments
- **Duplicate examples**: One clear example per pattern
- **Line-by-line explanations**: Trust the reader's engineering background
- **Complete file contents**: Reference key functions/structs only
- **Historical information**: Focus on current state
- **Granular metrics**: High-level stats only

### ‚ùå Red Flags

- Sections longer than 100 lines (except for comprehensive tables)
- Repeated code examples with minor variations
- Step-by-step tutorials (use Quick Reference instead)
- Detailed change logs (use git history)
- Implementation pseudo-code (reference actual files)

---

## Document Structure

```
1. Quick Reference (40-50 lines)
   - Essential patterns for immediate use
   - No explanations, just working code snippets

2. Project Overview (20-30 lines)
   - What the library does
   - Key features (bullet points)
   - Tech stack

3. Architecture (50-60 lines)
   - System flow diagram (ASCII art)
   - Core components table
   - Directory structure overview

4. Feature Sections (50-80 lines each)
   - One section per major feature
   - Overview ‚Üí Key Concepts ‚Üí Usage Example
   - Tables for structured data

5. Developer Guidelines (50-60 lines)
   - Adding new events
   - Adding new microservices
   - Common modification patterns

6. Design Decisions (20-30 lines)
   - Why X over Y (comparison tables)
   - Architectural rationale

7. Summary (20-30 lines)
   - Production-ready checklist
   - Key statistics
   - Critical concepts to remember
```

---

## Update Process

### Step 1: Analyze Current State

```bash
# Check current line count
wc -l CLAUDE.md

# Identify recent changes
git log --oneline -10

# Check Go version
go version

# List core files
ls -1 *.go event/*.go micro/*.go
```

### Step 2: Verify Accuracy

- Cross-reference mentioned files with actual codebase
- Validate code examples compile
- Check constants/types exist as documented
- Remove references to non-existent code

### Step 3: Update Content

Focus updates on:

1. **Metadata**: Date, Go version, dependency versions
2. **New features**: Add section if >100 LOC changed
3. **Removed features**: Delete outdated sections
4. **Architecture changes**: Update flow diagrams
5. **API changes**: Update Quick Reference

### Step 4: Condense if Needed

If over 400 lines:

- Merge similar examples
- Convert verbose text to tables
- Remove redundant explanations
- Simplify code examples (show concept, not production code)
- Delete low-value sections

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Code Examples

```go
// ‚úÖ Good: Shows pattern clearly
emitter.On(event.SomeEvent, func(handler saga.EventHandler) {
    payload := saga.ParsePayload(handler.Payload, &event.SomePayload{})
    // Process...
    handler.Channel.AckMessage()
})

// ‚ùå Bad: Too much context, not reusable
func handleAuthNewUserForSocialMicroservice(handler saga.EventHandler) {
    payload := saga.ParsePayload(handler.Payload, &event.AuthNewUserPayload{})

    // Check if user exists in database
    existingUser, err := db.FindUserByEmail(payload.Email)
    if err != nil {
        log.Error("Database error:", err)
        handler.Channel.NackWithFibonacciStrategy(19, 3)
        return
    }
    // ... 20 more lines
}
```

### Explanations

```markdown
‚úÖ Good: Concise with key insight
**Direct Exchange** chosen for audit because:

- Single consumer (audit microservice)
- No broadcast needed
- More efficient than headers exchange

‚ùå Bad: Over-explained
The audit feature uses a direct exchange instead of a headers exchange.
This is because the audit events only need to be consumed by a single
microservice (the audit microservice), and we don't need the broadcast
functionality that comes with a headers exchange. A direct exchange is
more efficient in this use case because it routes messages directly to
the queue using a routing key, whereas a headers exchange has to evaluate
multiple header attributes to determine routing...
```

### Tables vs Prose

```markdown
‚úÖ Good: Scannable table
| Feature | Events | Saga Commands |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Pattern | Pub/Sub | Point-to-point |
| Exchange | matching_exchange| commands_exchange|
| Consumers | Multiple | Single |

‚ùå Bad: Dense paragraph
Events use a publish/subscribe pattern with the matching_exchange which
is a headers exchange, whereas saga commands use a point-to-point pattern
with the commands_exchange which is a direct exchange. Events can have
multiple consumers across different microservices, but saga commands...
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### üö´ Documentation Drift

Don't document planned features or outdated code:

```markdown
‚ùå "In the future, we plan to add..."
‚ùå "The old ConnectToAudit() method (deprecated)..."
‚úÖ Document only what exists in the current codebase
```

### üö´ Tutorial Creep

Don't turn CLAUDE.md into a tutorial:

```markdown
‚ùå "Let's walk through how to build a microservice from scratch..."
‚ùå "Step 1: First, open your editor and create..."
‚úÖ "See Quick Reference for initialization pattern"
```

### üö´ Over-Specification

Don't duplicate information available in code:

```markdown
‚ùå Listing all 42 event types with descriptions
‚ùå Showing every field of every struct
‚úÖ "45 events total (42 business + 3 audit). See event/microserviceEvent.go"
```

### üö´ Inconsistent Depth

Don't explain some concepts in detail while glossing over others:

```markdown
‚ùå 150 lines on audit feature, 10 lines on saga orchestration
‚úÖ Balanced coverage (50-80 lines per major feature)
```

---

## Maintenance Frequency

- **After major feature**: Update immediately
- **After breaking change**: Update immediately
- **After bug fix**: Usually no update needed
- **After refactoring**: Update file references if changed
- **Monthly**: Verify accuracy and prune if >400 lines
- **Quarterly**: Refresh metadata and dependency versions

---

## Meta: Updating This Document

When updating `update_claude_prompt.md`:

- Keep under 300 lines
- Balance specificity with brevity
- Include concrete examples (good/bad comparisons)
- Focus on engineering judgment, not rigid rules
- Update when CLAUDE.md update patterns change
